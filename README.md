# Sisyphus-Simulator

Sisyphus is a character from Greek mythology who was punished by the gods for his deceitfulness. He was condemned to endlessly push a boulder up a hill, only for it to roll back down every time he reached the top. This story is often used to illustrate the idea of never-ending, futile tasks.

## Description
This game was created using Unreal Engine 5. Step into the shoes of Sisyphus and simulate his punishment.

## About the Project
This project is my first endeavor in Unreal Engine. Inspired by the story of Sisyphus, I aimed to explore the concept through game development. This marks another milestone in my game development journey.

## How to Play
The game is currently a work in progress.
